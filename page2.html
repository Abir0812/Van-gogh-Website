    <p>Perhaps van Gogh's most famous work, "The Starry Night" was painted during his stay at the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum. The painting combines observation with imagination, featuring a view from his window with an added village that he painted from memory.</p>
    
    <p>The swirling patterns in the sky demonstrate van Gogh's interest in movement and energy, while the cypress tree in the foreground creates a dramatic vertical element that contrasts with the horizontal village below.</p>
